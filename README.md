# ICP-Based DApp: Money Storage and Retrieval

This is a simple decentralized application (DApp) developed on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It allows users to store and retrieve money securely. It's a demonstration of ICP's capabilities, and in building this DApp, I learned about the following:

- How Internet Computer Blockchain Works
- Creating Canisters in ICP
- Deploying Canisters
- Working with Motoko Language
- Understanding Orthogonal Persistence

## Features

- Store Money: Users can securely store money in their accounts on the ICP blockchain.
- Retrieve Money: Users can retrieve their stored money whenever they need it.

## Live Site

The DApp is live at [https://7hnsi-aiaaa-aaaap-qbudq-cai.icp0.io/](https://7hnsi-aiaaa-aaaap-qbudq-cai.icp0.io/)
